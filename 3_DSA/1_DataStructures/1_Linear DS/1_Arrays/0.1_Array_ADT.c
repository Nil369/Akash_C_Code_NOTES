/*
Abstract data types(ADTs)are the ways of classifying data structures by providing a minimal expected 
interface and some set of methods. It is very similar to when we make a blueprint before actually 
getting into doing some job, be it constructing a computer or a building. The blueprint comprises
all the minimum required logistics and the roadmap to pursuing the job.


âœ…Array - ADT
An array ADT holds the collection of given elements (can be int, float, custom) accessible by their index.

    ðŸ”µ Minimal required functionality:
        We have two basic functionalities of an array, a get function to retrieve the element at index i 
        and a set function to assign an element to some index in the array.

    get (i) â€“ get element i
    set (i, num) â€“ set element i to num.

    ðŸ”µ Operations:-
        can have a whole lot of different operations on the array we created, but weâ€™ll limit ourselves to some basic ones.

        Max()
        Min()
        Search ( num )
        Insert ( i, num )
        Append (x)

âœ…Static and Dynamic Arrays:
Static arrays â€“ Size cannot be changed
Dynamic arrays â€“ Size can be changed

âœ…Memory Representations of Array:
Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
Elements in an array can be accessed using the base address in constant time â†’ O (1).
Although changing the size of an array is not possible, one can always 
reallocate it to some bigger memory location. Therefore resizing in an array is a costly operation.
