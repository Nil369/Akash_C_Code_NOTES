/*
A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. 
If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.


Use Sparse Matrix:
-> Storage: There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
-> Computing time: Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements.


Sparse Matrix Representations can be done in many ways,
These following are two common representations: 

1.Array representation
2.Linked list representation

/*

2D array is used to represent a sparse matrix in which there are three rows named as 

=> Row: Index of row, where non-zero element is located
=> Column: Index of column, where non-zero element is located
=> Value: Value of the non zero element located at index â€“ (row,column)
