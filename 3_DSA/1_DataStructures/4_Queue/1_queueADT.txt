A Queue is an abstract data type (ADT) that represents a collection of elements. 
It follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the element
that is inserted first is the one that gets removed first.

    Queues are widely used in scenarios such as scheduling processes, managing tasks, 
    and handling requests in a sequential manner.



âœ… Basic Operations of a Queue:
ðŸ”µEnqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
ðŸ”µDequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
ðŸ”µPeek/Front: Retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
ðŸ”µIsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
ðŸ”µIsFull: Checks if the queue is full (used in fixed-size implementations).
