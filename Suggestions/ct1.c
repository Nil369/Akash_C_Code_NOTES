//Q2. What are the type of operators in C? 
// Ans 2. See the image of my notes 



// Q3. What are Ternary / Conditional Operator in C ?

/* Ans 3.   
The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a compact way to express conditional statements in C programming. 
It allows you to make decisions based on a condition and assign a value to a variable depending on whether the condition evaluates to true or false. 
The general syntax of the ternary operator is ==>  condition ? expression1 : expression2

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    int max;

    // Using ternary operator to find the maximum value
    max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    printf("Maximum value is: %d\n", max);

    return 0;
} // OUTPUT => MAXIMUM VALUE IS 10



// Q4. Write the diff . between i++ & ++i

/* Ans 4.

| Feature              | `i++` (Post-increment)                                         | `++i` (Pre-increment)                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Operation            | Increment `i` after using its current value in the expression. | Increment `i` before using its current value in the expression.   |
| Value                | Returns the current value of `i`, then increments it.          | Increments `i` first, then returns its updated value.             |
| Effect on `i`        | Increases the value of `i` by 1 after the expression evaluation| Increases the value of `i` by 1 before the expression evaluation. |
| Example              | ```c int i = 5; int a = i++; // a = 5, i = 6; ```              | ```c int i = 5; int a = ++i; // a = 6, i = 6; ```                 |
| Common Use Case      | When you need to use the current value of `i` and then ‚¨ÜÔ∏è it   | When you need to increment `i` before using its value.            |

// Q5. What is type casting? What is implicit & explicit type casting ?

/* Ans 5. 
Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. 
In C, type casting allows you to change the data type of an expression's result to a different data type.

There are two types of type casting in C:
1. Implicit Type Casting: This type of casting is performed automatically by the compiler when necessary, without requiring any explicit instructions from the programmer. It's also known as "coercion".
2. Explicit Type Casting: This type of casting is performed explicitly by the programmer using casting operators. It's done by specifying the desired data type in parentheses before the value to be cast.
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Implicit type casting
    int a = 10;
    float b = 5.5;
    float sum = a + b; // Implicitly casts 'a' to float before addition

    printf("Implicit type casting:\n");
    printf("Sum = %f\n", sum); // Output:  Sum = 15.500000

    // Explicit type casting
    float c = 15.7;
    int d = (int)c; // Explicitly casts 'c' to int

    printf("\nExplicit type casting:\n");
    printf("d = %d\n", d); // Output: 15

    return 0;
}
// In this example:
// - Implicit type casting occurs when `a` (integer) is added to `b` (float). The integer `a` is implicitly converted to a float before the addition operation.
// - Explicit type casting is demonstrated when `c` (float) is explicitly cast to an integer `d` using `(int)c`. This truncates the fractional part of `c`.



// Q6. Waht is a loop? Explain the type of loops. what are break & continue statements?
// What are the difference between entry controlled & exit controlled loop?

/* Ans6.
‚ñ∫ Loops are control structures that allow the execution of a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met.
‚ñ∫  Common types of loops in C are:  for, while, and do-while.
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("\n\n*******Loop in C*********\n\n");
    int index = 0;
    while (index <= 10) // WHILE LOOP =>The while loop allows code to be executed multiple times, depending upon a boolean condition that is given as a test expression. While studying for loop, we have seen that the number of iterations is known, whereas while loops are used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop. The while loop execution is terminated on the basis of the Boolean (true or false) test condition.
    {
        printf("%d\n", index);
        index++;
    }

    for(int j = 0; j <= 100; j++) //FOR LOOP=> A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to efficiently write a loop that will execute a specific number of times.
    {
        printf("%d\n", j);
    }

    int j=0;
    do
    {
        printf("do while loop is runnig"); //DOWHILE LOOP => The main difference between the do-while loop and while loop is that, in the do-while loop, the condition is tested at the end of the loop body, whereas the other two loops are entry controlled loops.

                                            //Note: In do-while loop, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of the test condition.
    } while (j>5);
    

    return 0;
}
/*
‚´∏break statement:
When a break statement is encountered inside a loop whether it is a for loop or a while loop, the loop is terminated and the program continues with the statement immediately following the loop.
It is also used use in Switch-case statement to come out of the case

‚´∏continue statement:
Using a continue statement in the loop will cause the control to go directly to the test-condition and then it will continue the loop process.

‚´∏Entry-Controlled Loop:
In an entry-controlled loop, the condition is checked before the loop body is executed. If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not be executed at all.
These loops are also known as pre-tested loops.
Examples include while loop and for loop.

‚´∏Exit-Controlled Loop:
In an exit-controlled loop, the condition is checked after the loop body is executed. The loop body is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated.
These loops are also known as post-tested loops.
Example: do-while loop.

4. Central Processing Unit (CPU):
   - Main unit responsible for all activities within the computer.
   - Consists of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU).
   - ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations.

// Q10. What is Algorithm & Flowchart? Write few of its properties. Difference between Algorithm & flowchart

/* Ans 10. 

üü¶Algorithm:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.
It provides a sequence of instructions to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task.
Algorithms are independent of any programming language and are more focused on problem-solving logic.
They can be represented in natural language, pseudocode, or programming languages.
Algorithms are used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

Properties of an Algorithm:
Input: An algorithm should have zero or more inputs.
Output: An algorithm should produce one or more outputs.
Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm should be precisely defined and unambiguous.

üü¶Flowchart:
A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using different symbols and shapes.
It visually depicts the sequence of steps and decision points in an algorithm.
Flowcharts are helpful in understanding the logic of an algorithm and visualizing the flow of control.
They are used to represent complex algorithms in a clear and concise manner.
Flowcharts are used in various fields, including software development, business processes, and engineering.

Properties of a Flowchart:
Symbols: Flowcharts use standard symbols and shapes to represent different operations, decisions, and actions.
Flow of Control: Flowcharts depict the flow of control from one step to another, indicating the sequence of execution.
Clarity: Flowcharts should be clear and easy to understand, even for non-technical users.
